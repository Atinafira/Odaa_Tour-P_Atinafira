# ODAA Tours – Responsive Travel Website

## 🎨 Color System

Our color palette is designed to evoke calm, exploration, and trust, aligning with ODAA’s theme of wellness and travel:

- **Primary Color:** #2E8B57 (Sea Green) – Represents growth, tranquility, and nature.
- **Secondary Color:** #F4A261 (Soft Orange) – Adds warmth, energy, and a welcoming tone.
- **Accent Color:** #264653 (Charcoal Blue) – Provides contrast for CTA buttons and text.
- **Background/Base Colors:** White (#FFFFFF) and light gray tones for clarity and readability.

These colors were selected to create a harmonious balance between calm wellness themes and the excitement of adventure.

## 📱 Breakpoint Logic

Our layout is fully responsive and follows a mobile-first design approach. The breakpoints are:

- **XS - Mobile (0–575px):** 
  - Single-column layout
  - Nav becomes a hamburger menu (`☰`)
- **MD - Tablet (768px+):**
  - Switch to 2-column grid layout in service sections
  - Banner images align side-by-side with text
- **LG - Desktop (1024px+):**
  - Full-width grid layout
  - Complex sections like testimonials and partners are horizontally aligned

This logic ensures content is accessible and beautifully arranged across all screen sizes.

## 🎨 Creative Divergences from Mockup

Beyond color changes, we introduced several creative enhancements:

- **Visual Storytelling with Illustrations:**
  - Added unique banner-side images and service icons for personality and clarity.
  
- **Expanded Testimonials Section:**
  - Included carousel-like navigation and multiple perspectives to build trust.

- **Wellness + Travel Fusion:**
  - Merged wellness coaching ideas into a travel context (e.g., “Mindfulness Tours”).

- **Community & FAQ Emphasis:**
  - Enhanced user support sections with detailed FAQs and community CTA.

- **Animated Navbar Toggle:**
  - Mobile navigation includes a dynamic menu toggle interaction.

These elements differentiate the final design from a typical travel template by reinforcing the mental wellness and coaching mission of ODAA Tours.
